# Getting Started with Artifimo

This guide will walk you through the steps to start using Artifimo, from creating an account to generating your first leads.

## 1. Sign Up / Sign In

First, you'll need an Artifimo account.

*   **If you don't have an account:** Visit the [Sign Up page](/sign-up) and create a free account.  You can sign up using your email and a password, or conveniently with your Google account.  No credit card is required to start with the free plan.

*   **If you already have an account:** Go to the [Sign In page](/sign-in) and log in with your credentials.  You can also sign in using your Google account if you previously signed up that way.

## 2. Accessing the Dashboard

Once you've signed in, you'll be redirected to your Artifimo dashboard. This is your central hub for managing leads, generating new contacts, and adjusting your account settings.  You can access it anytime by clicking "Dashboard" in the navigation.

## 3. Understanding Plans and Usage (Free vs. Paid)

Artifimo offers different plans to suit your needs.  Here's a quick overview:

*   **Free Plan:** This plan allows you to test Artifimo with one free generation, which enables extracting data from one website. It's a great way to experience the core functionality.
*   **Paid Plans (Base, Plus, Enterprise):**  Paid plans unlock unlimited lead generation, advanced features, and higher usage limits. You can find detailed pricing information on our [Pricing Page](/pricing).

Your current plan and usage are displayed on the dashboard. You'll see how many "generations" you've used this month, and the limit for your current plan.  A "generation" is a successful extraction of contact data from a website (or multiple URLs associated with the same company).

## 4. Your First Lead Generation (Onboarding)

When you first sign up, Artifimo provides a short, interactive onboarding wizard to guide you through the process of generating your first leads. This wizard appears as a card on your dashboard. Click the **"Let's Get You Started"** button to begin.

The onboarding wizard consists of the following steps:

1.  **Welcome:** A brief introduction.

2.  **Add Company:** You'll be prompted to enter a company name and website. This creates a record for the company you want to target.

3.  **Generate Leads:**  You'll be asked to provide one or more website URLs. Artifimo will then use its AI to extract contact information.

4.  **Complete:**  A confirmation that your leads have been generated.

*If you choose to skip onboarding, you can always return to the process later by clicking the "Generate Leads" link in the sidebar navigation or the "Add New Lead" button on the "Leads" page.*

## 5. Navigating Artifimo

The main navigation elements are available in the sidebar:

*   **Dashboard:** Your main overview, showing usage and recent activity.
*   **Leads:**
    *   **Generate Leads:** This is where you input URLs to extract contact information (covered in more detail in "How It Works").
    *   **View Leads:**  This section displays all the leads you've generated, organized by company. You can view, edit, and export leads from here.
*   **Settings:**

    *   **Billing:** Manage your subscription and payment information.
    *   **General:** Update your account information (name, email).
