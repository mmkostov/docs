# API Reference

Currently, Artifimo does *not* offer a public API for direct programmatic access.  This feature is planned for future releases, specifically for Enterprise-level plans.

This document will be updated when the API becomes available.  The API is expected to provide functionality similar to the web interface, including:

*   **Lead Generation:**  Triggering lead extraction from websites using URLs.
*   **Data Retrieval:**  Accessing generated leads and company data.
*   **Account Management:** (Limited) Potentially managing team members and subscription details (depending on the final API design).

If you are interested in API access and would like to be notified when it becomes available, please [contact us](https://artifimo.com/contact) and express your interest. This will help us prioritize features and potentially provide early access.
