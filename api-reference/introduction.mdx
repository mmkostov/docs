The Artifimo Playground is a web-based interface that allows users to interact with language models and configure various settings for generating responses. This documentation provides an overview of the playground's functionality and how to use it effectively.

## Features

The Artifimo Playground offers the following features:

1. **Model Selection**: Users can select from a variety of language models to generate responses.
2. **Temperature Control**: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated responses. Higher values result in more diverse and creative outputs, while lower values produce more focused and deterministic responses.
3. **Top P and Top K**: These parameters control the diversity of the generated responses by limiting the probability mass and the number of tokens considered during sampling, respectively.
4. **Message Configuration**: Users can define the role (system, user, or assistant) and content of the messages sent to the language model.
5. **Real-time Interaction**: The playground provides a chat-like interface where users can input messages and receive generated responses in real-time.
6. **Output Display**: The generated responses are displayed in a dedicated output area, allowing users to view and analyze the model's output.

## Usage

To use the Artifimo Playground, follow these steps:

1. Access the playground through the provided web interface.
2. Configure the settings:
   - Select the desired language model from the dropdown menu.
   - Adjust the temperature, top P, and top K values using the input fields.
   - Choose the role (system, user, or assistant) for the message using the dropdown menu.
   - Enter the content of the message in the provided textarea.
3. Type your message in the input field at the bottom of the playground.
4. Click the "Send Message" button or press Enter to submit the message.
5. The generated response will appear in the output area above the input field.
6. Continue the conversation by entering new messages and receiving generated responses.

## Configuration

The playground provides various configuration options to customize the behavior of the language model:

- **Model**: Select the language model to be used for generating responses. The available models may vary depending on the deployment.
- **Temperature**: Adjust the temperature value (default: 0.7) to control the randomness of the generated responses. Higher values result in more diverse and creative outputs, while lower values produce more focused and deterministic responses.
- **Top P**: Set the top P value (default: 0.7) to control the diversity of the generated responses by limiting the cumulative probability mass considered during sampling.
- **Top K**: Set the top K value (default: 0.0) to control the diversity of the generated responses by limiting the number of tokens considered during sampling.
- **Role**: Choose the role (system, user, or assistant) for the message to provide context to the language model.
- **Content**: Enter the content of the message to provide additional context or instructions to the language model.

## Sharing

The playground allows users to share their conversations and configurations with others. Click the "Share" button to generate a shareable link that encapsulates the current state of the playground, including the selected model, configuration settings, and conversation history.

## Limitations

Please note the following limitations of the Artifimo Playground:

- The playground relies on the availability and performance of the underlying language models. Response times may vary depending on the model's size and complexity.
- The generated responses are based on the training data and capabilities of the selected language model. The accuracy, coherence, and appropriateness of the responses may vary.
- The playground is intended for interactive exploration and experimentation. It should not be used for critical or sensitive applications without proper evaluation and validation.

## Feedback and Support

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or would like to provide feedback, please contact our support team at support@artifimo.com. We appreciate your input and are committed to continuously improving the Artifimo Playground.

Happy exploring and interacting with the language models!
