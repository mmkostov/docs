# Troubleshooting

This section addresses common issues and questions you might encounter while using Artifimo.

## Lead Generation Issues

### 1. "No URLs Provided" Error

*   **Problem:**  You see this error when trying to generate leads.
*   **Cause:** You haven't entered any website URLs in the "Generate Leads" form.
*   **Solution:**  Make sure you've entered at least one valid URL in the text area, with each URL on a separate line.  Include the `http://` or `https://` prefix.

### 2. "Please Select a Company First" Error

*   **Problem:**  You receive this error when attempting to generate leads.
*   **Cause:** You haven't selected a company to associate the leads with.
*   **Solution:**  Choose an existing company from the dropdown menu, or create a new company using the "+" button.

### 3. "Failed to Scrape Data" Error

*   **Problem:**  Artifimo was unable to extract contact information from the provided URLs.
*   **Possible Causes:**
    *   **Website Structure:** The website's structure might be complex or use technologies that make it difficult to scrape.
    *   **No Contact Information:** The website might not publicly list the contact information you're looking for.
    *   **Website Errors:** The target website might be temporarily down or experiencing technical issues.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  The website might be blocking requests from Artifimo.
    *   **AI Processing Error:**  In rare cases, the AI might fail to correctly interpret the page content.

*   **Solutions:**
    *   **Try different URLs:**  Provide URLs to other pages on the same website, such as "About Us," "Team," or "Contact" pages.
    *   **Check the website manually:**  Visit the website yourself to see if contact information is readily visible. If it's not publicly displayed, Artifimo likely won't be able to find it.
    *   **Wait and try again:**  If the website is experiencing temporary issues, try again later.
    *   **Contact Support:** If you consistently encounter this error with a particular website and believe there should be contact information available, please [contact us](/contact) for assistance.

### 4. "Trial generation usage limit reached. Please upgrade your plan."

* **Problem:** You have used all of the lead generations available in your trial.
* **Solution:** Upgrade to a paid plan by clicking on the "Upgrade Plan" button.

### 5. "Monthly generation usage limit reached. Please wait until next month or upgrade your plan."
*   **Problem:**  You've reached the generation limit for your current plan.
*   **Solution:**  You can either wait until your monthly limit resets or upgrade to a higher plan for more generations.

### 6. Leads are not appearing in "View Leads" immediately.

*   **Problem:** You initiated a lead generation, but the results aren't showing up immediately.
*   **Cause:** Lead generation is an asynchronous process. It may take a few seconds or minutes for Artifimo to process the request and update the database.
*   **Solution:**  Wait a few moments and refresh the "View Leads" page. You can check the job's status by going to Settings -> Activity Log.

## Account and Billing Issues

### 1. "I forgot my password."

*   **Solution:**  Visit the [Forgot Password](/forgot-password) page and enter your email address. You'll receive instructions on how to reset your password.

### 2. "I'm having trouble updating my billing information."

*   **Solution:**  Go to "Settings" -> "Billing".  Click the "Manage Subscription" button. This will take you to the secure Stripe customer portal, where you can update your payment details, view invoices, and manage your subscription. If you continue to have issues, [contact support](/contact).

### 3. "How do I cancel my subscription?"

*   **Solution:**  Go to "Settings" -> "Billing". Click the "Manage Subscription" button. This will take you to the secure Stripe customer portal, where you can cancel your subscription.
