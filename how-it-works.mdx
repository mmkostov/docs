# How Artifimo Works: Generating Leads

This section explains the core functionality of Artifimo: extracting contact information from websites.

## The Lead Generation Process

1.  **Select or Create a Company:** Before you can generate leads, you need to associate them with a company. You have two options:

    *   **Select an Existing Company:** If you've previously added a company, choose it from the dropdown list on the "Generate Leads" page.
    *   **Add a New Company:** If the company isn't in your list, click the "+" (plus) button next to the dropdown. Enter the company's name and website, then click "Add Company."

2.  **Provide Website URLs:**  Once a company is selected, enter the website URL(s) you want Artifimo to analyze.  Here are some key points:

    *   **One URL per line:**  Enter each URL on a new line in the text area.
    *   **Multiple URLs are recommended:**  Providing multiple URLs, such as the company's homepage, "About Us" page, "Team" page, and "Contact" page, significantly increases the chances of finding contact information.
    *   **Include `http://` or `https://`:**  Ensure you include the full URL, including the protocol (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).
    *   **Example URLs:**
        ```
        https://www.example.com
        https://www.example.com/about
        https://www.example.com/team
        https://www.example.com/contact
        ```

3.  **Initiate Extraction:** Once you've entered the URL(s), click the "Extract Leads" button.

4.  **AI-Powered Processing:** Artifimo uses a combination of web scraping and Artificial Intelligence (specifically, Large Language Models or LLMs) to:

    *   **Visit and Analyze Websites:** Artifimo's "crawler" visits the provided URLs and extracts the content of the pages.
    *   **Identify Contact Information:** The AI analyzes the page content, looking for patterns and contextual clues to identify names, email addresses, phone numbers, job titles, and social media profiles.
    *   **Validate and Structure Data:** The extracted information is validated and organized into a structured format.

5.  **View Results:** After processing (which usually takes a few seconds to a few minutes), the results are displayed. You'll see a list of found contacts, including:

    *   **Names:** Names of individuals.
    *   **Roles:**  Job titles (if available).
    *   **Emails:** Verified email addresses.
    *   **Phone Numbers:**  Phone numbers (if available).
    *   **Social Links:** Links to social media profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).

6.  **Leads are Saved:**  The extracted contact information is automatically saved to your leads database, associated with the selected company. You can access and manage these leads from the "View Leads" page.

## Understanding Generations

Each time you successfully extract data from a website (or set of URLs), it's considered a "generation." Your Artifimo plan includes a certain number of generations per month (or a single generation for the free plan).  If a generation fails (e.g., due to a website error or no contact information being found), it is typically *not* counted against your limit.

## Tips for Effective Lead Generation

*   **Provide multiple, relevant URLs:**  Don't just enter the homepage. Include pages like "About Us," "Team," "Leadership," "Contact," or any page likely to contain staff information.
*   **Target the right companies:**  Focus on companies that are a good fit for your product or service.
*   **Check the results:** While Artifimo strives for high accuracy, it's always good to review the extracted information.
