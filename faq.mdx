# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This section answers common questions about Artifimo.

## General Questions

### What is Artifimo?

Artifimo is an AI-powered B2B lead generation tool that helps you find verified contact information (emails, phone numbers, social media profiles) from websites.

### How does Artifimo work?

Artifimo uses a combination of web scraping and artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and validate contact data.  You provide one or more website URLs, and Artifimo analyzes the content to identify and extract relevant information.

### What kind of contact information can Artifimo find?

Artifimo can find:

*   Email addresses
*   Phone numbers
*   Names
*   Job titles (roles)
*   Social media profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
*   Company information (website, industry, location)

### How accurate is the information?

Artifimo's AI validates the extracted data to ensure a high level of accuracy (aiming for 98%). However, like any automated system, it's not perfect.  The accuracy depends on the availability and clarity of information on the target websites.

### Is Artifimo legal and compliant?

Yes, Artifimo is designed to be compliant with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. We only extract publicly available information found on websites.  We do not use any private databases or unauthorized sources.

## Account and Subscription

### Do I need a credit card to sign up?

No, you can start with our Free plan, which doesn't require a credit card. You'll get one free generation to test out the service.

### What is a "generation"?

A generation is a successful extraction of contact data from a website (or a set of URLs related to the same company).  Each generation uses one credit from your monthly allowance (or your one free generation on the Free plan).

### What happens if I reach my generation limit?

If you reach your monthly generation limit, you'll need to wait until the next billing cycle for your limit to reset, or you can upgrade to a higher plan.

### Can I change or cancel my plan?

Yes, you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time through the "Settings" -> "Billing" section of your account.

### How can I invite team members?

If you have a paid plan, you can invite team members from the "Settings" -> "Team" section.  You'll need to be a team owner to do this.

## Using Artifimo

### How do I generate leads?

1.  Sign in to your Artifimo account.
2.  Go to "Leads" -> "Generate Leads" in the sidebar.
3.  Select or add a company.
4.  Enter the website URL(s) you want to scan.
5.  Click "Extract Leads."

### How many URLs should I enter?

We recommend entering multiple URLs related to the same company (e.g., homepage, "About Us" page, "Team" page, "Contact" page) to increase the chances of finding contact information.

### What if Artifimo can't find any contacts?

Sometimes, a website may not publicly list contact information, or the information might be presented in a way that's difficult to extract. If Artifimo can't find any contacts, it typically *won't* count against your generation limit. You can try:

*   Providing different URLs for the same company.
*   Targeting a different company.

### How can I export my leads?

You can export your leads to a CSV file from the "Leads" -> "View Leads" page.  Click the "Export" button.
